## Project Workflow
Does not meet expectations. No evidence of planning folder with ERD's and user stories inside repo. That's not to say you did not plan, just can't see any of it at the moment.

## Technical Requirements
Meets Expectations. Your app consists of 4 models. Though they are not entirely fleshed out with CRUD functionality. I think it'd be nice to create the CRUD functionality and then confiure authorization for the different pieces.

## Creativity / Interface
Meets Expectations. Should put meaningful dummy content into footer as filler for when you get this portfolio ready. I really liked the slider that you use to create a numeric review value. Overal UI is fluid. However I would make sure to change your headers and other filler content before you get this portfolio ready.

## Code Quality
Meets Expectations. The code is properly indented. It's severely lacking in comments. I would recommend you comment on any functionality you weren't entirely sure about and/or functionality that might need explaining to future you.

## Deployment and Functionality
~meets expectations. You tried to complete a whole bunch of functionality between omniauth, active admin, and friendly ID, which I commend you for. However, to what end do these API's serve? What functionality do you need in your MVP that requires these tools. I think the important take aways form this project is MVC and CRUD functionality for models. Which I can see throughout your application. But not one model has full 7 resource CRUD. The application is not deployed to heroku.

## Overall
Good job on the project. But I would feel much more comfortable about your knowledge base if I saw more evidence of CRUD in your application. As it stands right now, I have a good inclination that you understand it, because the CRUD that exists currently in your application does work; however, no single model has full CRUD actions associated with it. I think going further, you should really attempt to focus on MVP versus trying to incorporate as many technologies as you can. Great job though.
